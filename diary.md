# Diary

## Week 1:

### Monday, 22 November:
Today, after the morning lecture, we will start by getting to know the
team and the project itself. After that we will start work on collecting
requirements and perform a user analysis.

* Guðmundur:
    * User analysis and requirements
* Kolbeinn:
    * Requirements
* Kristófer:
    * MIA
* Smári:
    * Requirements
* Úlfur:
    * User analysis and requirements

There was not much work done on this day. Most of the day went into
getting to know each other and the project. We have however started
on gathering the requirements and found our target group for this
solution.


### Tuesday, 23 November:
Today, we will convert our requirements into use cases. Once we have
a broad overview of the use cases for the system we will start
designing the flow of the user interface. If we have time we will
start designing the interface as well.

* Guðmundur:
    * Use cases and use case diagram
* Kristófer:
    * MIA
* Kolbeinn:
    * Use cases
* Ríkharður (New member!):
    * UI Flow
* Smári:
    * Use cases
* Úlfur:
    * Use cases and UI flow, also started to explore designs
    for windows


Today, we were able to mostly complete writing the use cases. Each
one maps to a requirement and they were also placed in a use case
diagram. Once we got a broad overview of the use cases we started
to design the UI flow. When we got further along with both tasks
we started to experiment with UI designs.


### Wednesday, 24 November:
Today we will finish the use cases and start work on the design of
the program itself. We will be creating wireframes for every, or
at least close to every, window that the system will have. We will
also start creating the class diagrams for the three layers of the
system.
