# Diary

## Week 1:

### Monday, 22 November:
Today, after the morning lecture, we will start by getting to know the
team and the project itself. After that we will start work on collecting
requirements and perform a user analysis.

* Guðmundur:
    * User analysis and requirements
* Kolbeinn:
    * Requirements
* Kristófer:
    * MIA
* Smári:
    * Requirements
* Úlfur:
    * User analysis and requirements

There was not much work done on this day. Most of the day went into
getting to know each other and the project. We have however started
on gathering the requirements and found our target group for this
solution.


### Tuesday, 23 November:
Today, we will convert our requirements into use cases. Once we have
a broad overview of the use cases for the system we will start
designing the flow of the user interface. If we have time we will
start designing the interface as well.

* Guðmundur:
    * Use cases and use case diagram
* Kristófer:
    * MIA
* Kolbeinn:
    * Use cases
* Ríkharður (New member!):
    * UI Flow
* Smári:
    * Use cases
* Úlfur:
    * Use cases and UI flow, also started to explore designs
    for windows


Today, we were able to mostly complete writing the use cases. Each
one maps to a requirement and they were also placed in a use case
diagram. Once we got a broad overview of the use cases we started
to design the UI flow. When we got further along with both tasks
we started to experiment with UI designs.


### Wednesday, 24 November:
Today we will finish the use cases and start work on the design of
the program itself. We will be creating wireframes for every, or
at least close to every, window that the system will have. We will
also start creating the class diagrams for the three layers of the
system.

* Guðmundur:
    * 
* Kristófer:
    * 
* Kolbeinn:
    * 
* Ríkharður:
    * Finished UI Flow and worked on Use Cases
* Smári:
    * Use cases
* Úlfur:
    * Created initial draft of the look of many of the screens. Designed
    the database layer and initial draft of the other two.

We were able to finish the use cases and gotten far with the wireframes.
Most of the wireframes for the most important screens have been finished
apart from a few important ones dealing with the work requests and 
reports. The class diagram has been started and mostly finished for the
database and the other two layers have gotten some love as well.


### Thursday, 25 November:
Today we will clean up work done on the other days and finish what is
left. This is mostly the class diagrams, window design and some stragglers
in the use cases. We will also start work on detailing what each method
in the logic layer should do. This is to hopefully increase our work
throughput in the following weeks.

* Guðmundur:
    * 
* Kristófer:
    * 
* Kolbeinn:
    * 
* Ríkharður:
    * Worked on Class diagram and Use cases.
* Smári:
    * State diagram
* Úlfur:
    * Today I continued a bit with the class diagrams. After getting a
    better idea of it's structure I started work on explaining what each
    method in the logic layer should do. Finished about half of that.


Most of the puzzle pieces for the report are now ready. We just need to do
some cleanup and fixing. We left some design decisions, mostly regarding B
requirements, for tomorrow. We also started using Asana, a ticketing system,
to keep ourselves organized.


### Friday, 26 November:
We will start the day by filling Asana with all the tasks required for the
report. This will give us a better overview of what has been done and what
we still need to finish. We will also finish deciding on these design 
decisions we mentioned above. Put the puzzle pieces together into a
complete report.

* Guðmundur:
    * 
* Kristófer:
    * 
* Kolbeinn:
    * 
* Ríkharður:
    * Class diagram finished and worked on the design report.
* Smári:
    * "Beutifying" Report 
* Úlfur:
    * Created all the tasks in Asana. Most of the day went into the last
    design decisions and creating wireframes and details for them. Finished
    the day further detailing the logic layer and reviewing the report.

Last design day finished!! The week went mostly well, some days better than others.
We have a finished product that should (hopefully) not need to be changed all that
much. We will possibly do some more prep work over the weekend, like adding tickets
to Asana, but we will try to relax as well :)
