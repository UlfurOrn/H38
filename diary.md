### Tuesday, 23 November:
Today, we started off by gathering the use cases and inserting them into a use case table.
The table includes pre conditions, descriptions, post condion,..., etc for each use case.
Later on Úlfur presented the group with a sketch of a possible interface design. 
The group was pleased with the sketch, though we have not yet decieded on a final design for the interface.
We also kept working on and updating the diagrams, i.e structural and behavioural.
